# 𓁱 Ptah

Kubernetes development toolkit, with a focus on rapid iteration and local
hosting.

Helps streamline the N "random" commands you need to get up and running, so you can focus on
figuring out how to make X work inside a Kubernetes environment.

Named after the [Egyptian god of creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah)

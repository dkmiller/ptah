# ìÅ± Ptah

Kubernetes development toolkit, with a focus on rapid iteration and local hosting. Ptah streamlines
the many commands you need to get up and running:

- Installing Docker, Kind, Helm, etc.
- Initializing a local Kubernetes cluster
- Building N Docker images and transferring them to the cluster
- Port-forwarding all your deployments
- (... and more)

so you can focus on figuring out how to do whatever it is you're trying to achieve in a
Kubernetes environment.

**If you're not sure where to start, check out the
[First Ptah project](./tutorials/first-project.md) tutorial.**

Ptah is named after the [Egyptian god of creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah).
